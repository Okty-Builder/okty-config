In a way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, 
rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications 
to **use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on** and only requires 
applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer.
This gives a **significant performance boost** and **reduces the size of the application**.

And importantly, **Docker is open source**. This means that anyone can contribute to Docker 
and extend it to meet their own needs if they need additional features that aren't available
 out of the box.

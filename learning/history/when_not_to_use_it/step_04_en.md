**Security is critical to your application.**
As mentioned above, keeping the different components of an application in separate containers 
provides some security benefits, since a compromise in one container can’t easily affect the 
rest of your system. However, Docker’s containerization approach raises its own security 
challenges, especially for more complicated applications. These issues are solvable, but require 
attention from an experienced security engineer.

 **Performance is critical to your application.** Docker shines compared to virtual machines when it 
comes to performance because containers share the host kernel and do not emulate a full operating system.  
However, Docker does impose performance costs. Processes running within a container will not be quite as
fast as those run on the native OS. If you need to get the best possible performance out of your server, 
you may want to avoid Docker.

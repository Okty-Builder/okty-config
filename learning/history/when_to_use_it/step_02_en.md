**Basic use cases:** Pulling images from Docker Hub is also a good solution if your application is basic 
or standard enough to work with a default Docker image. Cases such as hosting a website using a LAMP stack, 
using a reverse proxy, or setting up a Minecraft server often have an official or well-supported image 
available on DockerHub. If the default configuration in these images is acceptable for your needs, 
then pulling the image can save a lot of time that would otherwise be spent setting up your environment 
and installing the necessary tools.

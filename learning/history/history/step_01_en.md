**Solomon Hykes started Docker** in France as an internal project within dotCloud, a platform-as-a-service company, 
with initial contributions by other dotCloud engineers **including Andrea Luzzardi and Francois-Xavier Bourlet**. 
Jeff Lindsay also became involved as an independent collaborator. Docker represents an evolution of dotCloud's 
proprietary technology, which is itself built on earlier open-source projects such as Cloudlets.
